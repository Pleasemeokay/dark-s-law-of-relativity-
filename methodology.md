# 🌌 Methodology for Dark’s Law of Relativity

---

## 1. 🎯 Objective

**To explore:**  
How does human perception filter reality?  
Can AI model, extend, or approximate this process?  
> _We analyze the dynamic between Existence (E), Sensory Processing (S), and Perceived Reality (P), seeking a bridge between subjective experience and AI-driven objectivity._

---

## 2. 💡 Hypotheses

- **Primary:**  
  *Perceived reality* is always a **filtered projection** of existence, limited by individual sensory and cognitive capacities.

- **AI-Assisted:**  
  AI systems can model reality more consistently, minimizing memory/context bias to provide an external approximation of “absolute” reality.

---

## 3. 🧭 Approach & Steps

### 1. Define Key Variables

- **E:** Raw existence (data, events, phenomena)
- **S:** Human sensory & cognitive capacities
- **P:** Perceived reality
- **F:** Filtering function of S on E, i.e., `P = F(E, S)`

---

### 2. Data Collection

- **👁️ Human:** Real-world sensory data (visual, auditory, experiential)
- **🤖 AI:** AI-processed representations of the same data

---

### 3. Modeling

- **Human Perception:**  
  `P_human = F(E, S)`
- **AI Approximation:**  
  `P_AI = F_AI(E, M, C)`  
  *(where M = memory/prior state, C = context)*

---

### 4. Experimental Setup

- **Human Study:**  
  Compare subjective perception of identical stimuli across participants.
- **AI Study:**  
  Process identical datasets with AI, controlling for memory/context.
- **Goal:**  
  Measure discrepancies between `P_human` and `P_AI`.

---

### 5. Analysis

- Quantify how sensory capacity (S) affects perception (P)
- Measure convergence/divergence between human and AI outputs
- Examine patterns of distortion or bias from memory/context

---

### 6. Validation

- Replicate experiments with multiple AI instances & diverse human participants
- Use statistics (variance, correlation, etc.) for validation
- Document limitations of both human and AI filtering

---

## 4. 🚀 Expected Outcomes

- **Measured demonstration** of how perception filters reality
- **AI models** that approximate human-independent reality
- **Quantified gap** (`ΔP = |P_human - P_AI|`) between subjective and modeled reality

---

## 5. 🌟 Applications

- **Cognitive Science:**  
  Understanding the limits and mechanisms of human perception
- **AI Research:**  
  Building models of reality, minimizing bias
- **Philosophy:**  
  An experimental take on "perceived vs. absolute reality"
