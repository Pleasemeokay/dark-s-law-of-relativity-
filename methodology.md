Methodology for Dark’s Law of Relativity

1. Objective

To study and analyze how human perception filters reality, and how this can be modeled, approximated, or extended using AI systems. The study aims to explore the relationship between existence (E), sensory capacity (S), and perceived reality (R).

2. Hypothesis

Primary Hypothesis: Perceived reality  is always a filtered projection of existence , limited by individual sensory and cognitive capacities .

AI-Assisted Hypothesis: AI systems can model aspects of reality more consistently by minimizing memory and context bias, providing an external approximation of “absolute” reality.

3. Approach / Steps

1. Define Variables

 = Raw existence (data, events, phenomena)

 = Human sensory and cognitive capacities

 = Perceived reality

 = Filtering function of S on E



2. Data Collection

Collect real-world sensory data: visual, auditory, and experiential observations.

Collect AI-processed representations of the same data for comparison.



3. Modeling

Represent human perception mathematically as .

Model AI approximation as , where:

 = Input data

 = Memory/prior state

 = Contextual parameters




4. Experimental Setup

Human Study: Compare subjective perception of the same stimuli across participants.

AI Study: Process identical datasets using AI with controlled memory/context parameters.

Measure the discrepancies between  and .



5. Analysis

Quantify how sensory capacity  affects .

Measure convergence between human perception and AI outputs.

Examine patterns of distortion or bias introduced by memory/context.



6. Validation

Repeat experiments with multiple AI instances and human participants.

Use statistical methods (e.g., variance, correlation) to validate relationships.

Document limitations of human sensory filtering and AI modeling.

4. Expected Outcomes

A measurable demonstration of how perception filters reality.

AI models that approximate human-independent representations of reality.

Quantification of gaps () between subjective perception and modeled reality.

5. Applications

Cognitive science: Understanding human perception limits.

AI research: Modeling reality and minimizing bias.

Philosophy: Experimental approach to the age-old problem of “perceived vs absolute reality.
