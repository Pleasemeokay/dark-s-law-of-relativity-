# dark-s-law-of-relativity-
the simple law that explains the relativity of this universe 


Dark’s Relativity:

R = E * φ(S)

Principle:
Reality (R) is not existence (E) itself, but existence filtered through the limits of sensory capacity (S). What we perceive is always a projection, never the whole truth.
