# Study for Dark’s Law of Relativity

## 1. Objective
To empirically explore how human perception filters reality and how AI systems can model or approximate objective patterns of existence, testing the principle:

R = E * φ(S)

Where human perception (R) is always a filtered projection of existence (E).

## 2. Hypotheses
1. **Primary Hypothesis:** Humans perceive a distorted version of reality based on sensory and cognitive limits (φ(S)).  
2. **AI-Assisted Hypothesis:** AI systems, when memory and context are controlled, can generate consistent outputs approximating “absolute” reality.

## 3. Experimental Design

### 3.1 Human Perception Study
- **Participants:** 20–50 volunteers of diverse sensory abilities.  
- **Stimuli:** Visual, auditory, and textual datasets representing real-world phenomena.  
- **Task:** Participants report perceptions of the stimuli.  
- **Measurement:** Quantify differences between reported perceptions and actual data.

### 3.2 AI Modeling Study
- **AI Setup:**  
  - Use multiple AI instances (e.g., GPT, LLMs, perception-based neural networks)  
  - Control memory (M(t)) and context (C(t)) to neutralize bias  
- **Input:** Same datasets used in the human study.  
- **Output:** Modeled representation of the stimuli (R_ai(t)).

## 4. Data Collection
- **Human:** Survey responses, reaction times, confidence levels, error rates.  
- **AI:** Output text, probabilities, embeddings, or generated visual/audio interpretations.

---

## 5. Analysis
- **Discrepancy Measure:**

ΔR = |R_human - R_ai|

- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  - Correlation analysis between perceived and actual reality  
  - Variance analysis to quantify influence of sensory limits (φ(S))  
  - Convergence analysis between AI outputs across different instances

- **Visualization:**  
  - Heatmaps of perception errors  
  - Graphs showing ΔR over time and across contexts

---

## 6. Expected Outcomes
- Confirmation that human perception is filtered and subjective.  
- AI outputs converge to consistent representations when biases are minimized.  
- Quantitative measure of the “distance” between filtered perception and modeled reality.  
- Insight into how AI can function as a cognitive extension for humans.

---

## 7. Applications
- Cognitive Science: Map human sensory and cognitive limitations.  
- AI Research: Develop models for unbiased perception of reality.  
- Philosophy: Provide experimental support for theories of reality and perception.

---

## 8. Limitations
- AI outputs are still dependent on training data; absolute reality is approximated, not guaranteed.  
- Human perception study limited by participant diversity and experimental setup.  
- Sensory dimensions studied may not cover all modalities of human experience.
